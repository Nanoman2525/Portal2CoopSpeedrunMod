# Portal 2 Coop Speedrun Mod
A speedrun mod for Portal 2's cooperative campaign. This is a simple script that is to be run on map loads to bring about new features!

## Compatible Platforms
- Only accessible via all PC platforms at the moment.

## Installation
- Should be ran using a plugin through ServerActivate, but the official method of running has yet to be determined. I'm looking into getting this into SourceAutoRecord.

## Features
- Support for Pre-DLC Portal 2.
- The Calibration Course begins once an Orange player pings the periodic table of elements.
  - Done this way so that timing is not advantageous to those who spawn in faster.
- Levels end immediately after both players enter the disassemblers.
  - Final maps in standard courses transition after inserting the disc.
  - Crazier Box cutscene starts immediately once the players reach the ending camera.
- Checkpoint doors open immediately after both partners reach one.
  - Players can bunnyhop at a comfortable speed straight through a checkpoint.
- Automatic taunting scenes have been removed.
  - They are silently awarded to the players instead.
- Players are boosted downwards after spawning into disc maps.
- Tractor beams are faster.
  - They are accelerated to make the puzzles quicker, but only up to the point where they still work with the intended route.
- Gel spreads have maximum streaking potential.
  - One blob can pretty much coat an entire floor in its direction.
- Other miscellaneous changes and QOL improvements.
